## Introduction

Problem description and (if any) background of the algorithms.

## Algorithm Specification

Description (pseudo-code preferred) of all the algorithms involved for solving the problem, including specifications of main data structures.

## Testing Results

Table of test cases. Each test case usually consists of a brief description of the purpose of this case, the expected result, the actual behavior of your program, the possible cause of a bug if your program does not function as expected, and the current status ('pass', or 'corrected', or 'pending').

## Analysis and Comments

Analysis on the time and space complexities of the algorithms. Comments on further possible improvements.

## Appendix: C code

```C
/* Insert C code here */
```
At least 30% of the lines must be commented.  Otherwise the code will NOT be evaluated.
